## How to Run

### C# Assignments

Each C# folder contains a single `Program.cs`. Pick one of these options:

**Option A — run with `dotnet` (recommended)**

```bash
cd 02_drone_system
dotnet new console -n temp -o . --force
# Program.cs will be picked up automatically
dotnet run
```

Or convert each folder into its own SDK-style project by adding a `.csproj` like the one in `25_expense_sharing_efcore`.

**Option B — .NET Fiddle / online**

Paste `Program.cs` contents into https://dotnetfiddle.net/ and click Run.

### SQL Assignments

Open in SSMS, Azure Data Studio, DBeaver, or any SQL client. Each `.sql` file is self-contained:
- Creates tables (drop them first if rerunning)
- Inserts sample data
- Runs all the required queries

Tested with SQL Server syntax (`IDENTITY`, `GETDATE()`, `DATEDIFF`, `DATENAME`). For MySQL/PostgreSQL, minor tweaks to `IDENTITY`/`GETDATE()` may be needed.

### EF Core Expense Sharing App (`25_expense_sharing_efcore`)

```bash
cd 25_expense_sharing_efcore
dotnet restore
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
dotnet ef database update
dotnet run
```

Uses **SQLite** by default (file-based — no server required).

## Notes

- All code is original and written to demonstrate clean C# / SQL practices.
- Comments at the top of each file explain the assignment objective.
- The repository is **private** — only the owner can see it.
